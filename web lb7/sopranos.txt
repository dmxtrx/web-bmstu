Tony: It's good to be in something from the ground floor. 
I came too late for that and I know. 
But lately, I'm getting the feeling that I came in at the end. 
The best is over.
Melfi: Many Americans, I think, feel that way.
Tony: I think about my father. He never reached the heights like me. 
But in a lot of ways he had it better. He had his people. I love New Jersey!
